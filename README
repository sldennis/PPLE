Use the create_table.sql to import the database to the server.

The login table contains the default administrator account, change the id field to your own email address. 
Enter a new name for your profile. There can be multiple profiles on a single database, and each profile is 
like a datbase on its own. The password field is a md5 hash, the default password is 'password'.

The influence table contains the ownership information, while the radar table contains the viewership information. 
Change the id field in the influence table to the email you just entered for the id field of the login table.

The config.php contains the variables where you can set your database connection, smtp server and administrative email.

The notification.php contains the links to your APNS cert, which by default is named pple_prod.pem, under the cert folder.

Once ready, download the PPLE app from the appstore, if you haven't done so. Go to the settings tab, and add a new profile.
Profile Name = profile in the login table
Profile URL = mywsdl.php of the url where this program is installed. e.g www.yourdomain.com/pple/mywsdl.php
Login ID = id in the login table. 
Login Password = password in the login table. 

Use the administrator account first. Afterwhich, you can add new users from the PPLE app.
